# 🚀 End-to-End Text Summarization System (Production-Ready)

A **production-grade NLP system** for abstractive text summarization built using **Hugging Face Transformers**, **PyTorch**, and **modern MLOps practices**. 

This project demonstrates how to design, train, deploy, and scale a real-world machine learning system with CI/CD automation and cloud deployment.


## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository implements an **end-to-end text summarization pipeline** that covers:

- Data ingestion and validation  
- Text preprocessing and transformation  
- Model training and evaluation  
- API-based inference  
- Containerization and cloud deployment  

The system is designed with **modularity, scalability, and production-readiness** in mind.


## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔹 End-to-end ML pipeline (ingestion → inference)
- 🔹 Modular, clean architecture
- 🔹 Hugging Face PEGASUS-based abstractive summarization
- 🔹 Configuration-driven design (YAML-based)
- 🔹 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
